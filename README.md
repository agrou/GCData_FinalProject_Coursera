# Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Project

A repository for the final project of the Coursera's Course: Getting and Cleaning Data

This project includes an R script called run_analysis.R that includes all the code to:

1. Merge training and test sets to create a data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The repository also includes a second independent tidy data set ```tidy_data.txt``` with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A description of all the variables and transformations to the data can be found in the CodeBook.mdfile.
